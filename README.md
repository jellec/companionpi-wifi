# CompanionPi Setup

This script configures a Raspberry Pi as a CompanionPi access point with network configurator:

- WiFi as Access Point with SSID and password
- DHCP server on wlan0
- eth0 tries DHCP and falls back to static IP if no lease in 30 seconds
- Web interface on port 8001 to review/change configuration
